# Gdansk_Airport

### Scrape Video
This repository contains a Python script that allows you to capture live video and corresponding image frames from the Gdansk Airport live feed available at [Gdansk Airport Webcams](https://www.airport.gdansk.pl/lotnisko/kamery-internetowe-p30.html).
Before running the script, make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed and available in your system's PATH.

To capture the video and corresponding image frames, run the `capture_video.py` script with the desired frame interval and record duration.

```bash
python3 capture_vide.py --frame_interval 10 --record_duration 60
```
For more information and available options, you can use the help command:
```bash
python3 capture_video.py --help
```
